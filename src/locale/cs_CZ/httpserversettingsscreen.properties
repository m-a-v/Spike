If you don't want to do the edits yourself, you can download Katie's edited version (it's up to date with the original Loop version) and deploy it directly to your device. It's available <a href\="https\://github.com/Kdisimone/Loop/tree/spike-master"><font color\="\#0086FF">here (https\://github.com/Kdisimone/Loop/tree/spike-master)</font></a>. If you wish to perform the edits yourself, open the original Loop code in Xcode and, in the Project Navigator, go to Loop > Models > ServiceAuthentication and open the file "ShareService.swift". Delete the characters "/*" from line 55 and "*/" from line 62. Replace "https\://REPLACEME" with "http\://127.0.0.1\:1979". Replace "Custom" with "Spike".

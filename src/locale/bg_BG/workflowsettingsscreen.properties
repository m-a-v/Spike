workflow_instruction_body=Make sure you have the Workflow app (if using iOS 11 or lower) or the Shortcuts app (if using iOS 12 or higher) installed on your device. You can get it for free by searching the App Store.\n\nAfter the app is installed on your device, go to your Today View and add the Workflow/Shortcuts Today Widget. If you have an Apple Watch you can also run workflows directly from the watch as long as you install the correspondent app on it. You can do this directly from the Watch app on your device. \n\nTo configure both the Today Widget and Apple Watch press on any of the listed buttons on this screen and a popup will appear, select "Copy to Workflow" or "Copy to Shortcuts" (depending on what app you're installed), press on "Get Shortcut" if you're using Shortcuts (if you're using Workflow this step doesn't exist), then press "Done" on the upper right corner of the screen. The workflow will now be ready to use from your Today Widget / Apple Watch.
workflow_instruction_apple_watch_disclaimer=Note\: If you're on iOS 12 and using the Shortcuts app, there's still no Apple Watch app available (only a Today Widget). Apple should release the Apple Watch app soon but, for now, it's only available on iOS 11 or lower.

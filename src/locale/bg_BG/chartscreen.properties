predictions_cob_blood_glucose=Predicted COB BG
predictions_unannounced_glucose_blood_glucose=Predicted UAG BG
IOB_prediction_curve_explanation_title=IOB (Insulin-On-Board)
IOB_prediction_curve_explanation_content=This is a predicted BG curve that is based on insulin only. If no insulin (IOB) is present, this predicted BG curve will only take into account the current BG trend and things like "BG momentum".\n\nWhen insulin is present, this predicted BG curve represents how BG SHOULD behave based on insulin activity alone. The keyword here is "SHOULD" because Spike is relying on mathematical models to predict the future.
COB_prediction_curve_explanation_title=COB (Carbs-On-Board)
COB_prediction_curve_explanation_content=Uses carbs and insulin (if available) together in predicting the BG curve.\n\nThis prediction line will show an S-curve shape immediately after entering carbs that starts out flat (in line with current BG trends) and then rises sharply after about an hour before flattening out. A typical meal absorption time of about 3 hours is assumed which is then adjusted over time as Spike gradually relies more on actual observed carb absorption data (carb absorption is determined by looking at how BG trend is behaving over time). The COB predictive curve can only go so far in its prediction of BGs because it is limited to the carbs entered, unlike the UAG curve.\n\nCOB predicts how BG SHOULD behave in the presence of carbs and/or insulin. The keyword here is "SHOULD" because Spike is relying on mathematical models to predict the future.
UAG_prediction_curve_explanation_title=UAG (UnAnnounced Glucose)
UAG_prediction_curve_explanation_content=Uses "floating carbs" and insulin (if available) together in predicting the BG curve.\n\nUnlike the COB predictive BG curve, UAG is not restricted to the carb entry provided by the user. In a way, it doesn’t "trust" carb entries as much. It fact-checks carb entries by looking (retrospectively) at glucose deviation comparisons. UAG is predicting the future BGs based on the slope (rate of change in BG) of actual BGs during periods where Spike believes unannounced glucose is present, either by having meals that are not logged into Spike, by under counting carbs in a meal or by sudden glucose spikes released by the liver into the blood stream caused by stress, the dawn phenomenon, etc.\n\nIf BGs are rising during a meal or glucose spike and they continue to rise beyond what was predicted on carbs alone (strong deviations happening), UAG is going to carry that prediction forward... regardless of the carbs entered.  And it will carry that forward until the slope stops and things settle down.\n\nWhile COB and IOB predictive BG curves show how BG SHOULD behave based on current trend and IOB/COB alone, the UAG predictive BG curve show how BG IS ACTUALLY behaving based on current trend, IOB/COB and expected/unexpected glucose deviations.\n\nThe keyword here is "ACTUALLY" because Spike is relying on observed data and glucose deviations to predict the future.
default_prediction_explanation=Based on current BG trend, momentum, retroactive deviations, etc. Spike believes this is the most relevant predictive BG curve at this exact moment in time and has marked it as default (purple).
enable_disable_predictions_pill_explanation_title=Enable/Disable
enable_disable_predictions_pill_explanation_body=Enable or disable predictions on the chart.
predictions_duration_pill_explanation_body=Desired duration for predictions. The bigger the time frame selected at the bottom of the chart, the bigger the duration of predictions can be (up to a maximum of 4h).
predictions_iob_cob_pill_explanation_body=Allow/disallow Spike to take IOB/COB into account when calculating predictions. For accurate results, it's highly recommended to set your ISF and I\:C in Settings > Treatments > Profile.
predictions_time_until_high_pill_explanation_body=Approximate time, in minutes, until BG reaches your high threshold.
predictions_time_until_low_pill_explanation_body=Approximate time, in minutes, until BG reaches your low threshold.
predictions_treatments_outcome_pill_explanation_body=Final BG outcome of all active insulin/carbs treatments. This is the same outcome given by the Bolus Calculator.
predictions_treatments_effect_pill_explanation_body=The effect that all active insulin/carbs treatments will have on your BG (outcome - latest BG reading).
predictions_uag_predicted_bg_pill_explanation_body=Predicted BG taking only into account the UAG (UnAnnounced Glucose) curve and prediction's duration selected by the user.
predictions_iob_predicted_bg_pill_explanation_body=Predicted BG taking only into account the IOB (Insulin On Board) curve and prediction's duration selected by the user.
predictions_cob_predicted_bg_pill_explanation_body=Predicted BG taking only into account the COB (Carbs On Board) curve and prediction's duration selected by the user.
predictions_minimum_predicted_bg_pill_explanation_body=Lowest predicted value that Spike has made for your future BG.
predictions_carb_impact_pill_explanation_body=The degree at which BG is being impacted by logged and unlogged carbs/glucose.
predictions_bg_impact_pill_explanation_body=Current impact of active insulin and currently digesting carbohydrates.\n\nIt shows you what your BG “should” be doing, assuming insulin and carbohydrate activity are the only major contributing factors.\n\nFor example, if BG delta is +2 mg/dL and BGI is +2.6 mg/dL, your BG is currently doing what you’d expect based on current insulin and carb activity (both delta and BG impact are similar). If, on the other hand, the actual BG change (delta) and the predicted BGI are very different, your BGs are not behaving as predicted, so the purple prediction line may not end up reflecting reality. This can happen due to incorrect ISF/I\:C settings, unlogged or incorrectly logged insulin/carbs or external factors like stress, etc.
predictions_deviation_pill_explanation_body=How much actual BG change is deviating from BG Impact. A high positive/negative deviation number means your BGs are not behaving as predicted, so the purple prediction line may not end up reflecting reality.
predictions_bg_velocity_pill_explanation_body=How much BG is rising/falling each minute.
predictions_eventual_bg_pill_explanation_body=Predicted BG after DIA (hours) considering your current IOB and COB.
oref0_algorithm_cob_curve_explanation=Future COB values are not possible to predict when using the oref0 algorithm. COB is calculated in real time by constantly analyzing BG trend and deviations instead of considering carbohydrate absorption as linear. For that reason, the graph above only shows past and present COB values.

incomplete_user_profile=Warning\: Your current profile is incomplete\! For more precise predictions, head over to Settings > Treatments > Profile and make sure you've added your ISF, I\:C and Carb Absorption Rate.
single_prediction_curve_label=Single Prediction Curve
predictions_single_prediction_curve_pill_explanation_body=Spike will determine and display, on the chart, only the most relevant prediction curve (UAG, COB or IOB). The remaining prediction curves will be ignored.
ZT_prediction_curve_explanation_title=ZT (Zero Temp)
ZT_prediction_curve_explanation_content=Prediction BG curve representing a scenario where a zero temp is given (zero basal insulin).\n\nZT predicts how BG SHOULD behave in the absence of basal insulin. The keyword here is "SHOULD" because Spike is relying on mathematical models to predict the future.
